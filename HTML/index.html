            <p>     Hello! My name is Valeria Heredia and I am currently pursing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with minors in 
                Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University. My expected graduation is May 2023, however I plan to further pursue a
                master's degree in Computer Science. </p>

                <p>        I aim to become a software engineer and am currently studying many different areas of programming. My main interest at the moment is embedded software
                but I'm having a lot of fun learning about web development. </p>

                 <p>   My strong suits include C++, LabVIEW, UI Developement, and embedded software, but I am eager to gain more experience and learn different skills. 
                My favorite part of working with other programmers is seeing the different techniques and ideas come together. </p>

                    <p>Feel free to contact me and/or view the code for this website!
